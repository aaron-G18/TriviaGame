This is a trivia game based on the HBO series Game of Thrones. You will be given a set amount of time to answer each question. if you don't answer each question before the timer runs out, it will count as an incorrect guess. Each time you play the game you will be given 20 random questions to try to answer. Give it a try and test your G.O.T. knowledge.

The main focus of this trivia game was to implement "timers" using the JavaScript setInterval() method. I created "countdown timers" by executing the decrement function every second (1000 milliseconds) in the setInterval parameters.

```
setInterval(decrement, 1000)
```
